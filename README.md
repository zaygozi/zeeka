## Installation
```javascript
npm install -g zeeka
```

## Usage
#### The gif posted above is self explanatory.
#### Just choose a directory/folder to share, set a username and password & mention any subdomain to connect your filesystem to the internet.
#### If the subdomain is available, it will be assigned, else an auto generated subdomain will be assigned.
#### A zeeka link will be generated on pressing Enter and a local web server will start on port 5000.
#### Share this link and the credentials with your friends & start sharing &#x1F34E;
