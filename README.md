## Installation
```javascript
npm install -g zeeka
```

<br>

## Usage
#### The gif posted above is self explanatory.
#### Just choose a directory/folder to share, set a username and password & mention any subdomain to connect your filesystem to the internet.
#### If the subdomain is available, it will be assigned, else an auto generated subdomain will be assigned.
#### A zeeka link will be generated on pressing Enter and a local web server will start on port 5000.
#### Share this link and the credentials with your friends & start sharing &#x1F34E;

## Zeeka Vs Cloud Sharing
#### Normally if you want to share files with someone remotely, you have to upload them to third party servers or cloud storage services. You then provide a link to people who wish to access your files.
#### Zeeka works differently! Zeeka connects a directory in your filesystem to the internet. You set your own credentials, so you have full control on who can access that directory. People having access can upload, download, create or modify files in that directory from anywhere in the world.
#### This eliminates the overhead of uploading files to third party servers and then trusting them with your data.

## Credits
#### Zeeka uses ZeekaFileManager (https://github.com/zaygozi/ZeekaFileManager) which is a fork of RichFileManager (https://github.com/servocoder/RichFileManager) for its web frontend.
#### Zeeka is currently using localtunnel public servers in its beta phase.

## How Can I Contribute?
#### Contributions are always welcome as I am a normal college student who created this tool to share files with his friends.
#### Currently I am looking for people who can contribute in setting up Zeeka dedicated servers, so that we can unleash the full potential of Zeeka.
#### I dont know how I'll fund these dedicated servers for a long time, but hey someone needs to do it, for the future of secure file sharing.
#### Long term goal is to incorporate Zeeka as a native tool in all linux distros. Everyone needs to have access to free and secure file sharing.
#### If you are interested in joining the cause, do write in the Issues section.

## Warning
#### Currently working on Linux & Mac OS
#### Dont expect high performance or strong connectivity in the beta phase as requests are routed through public servers managed by localtunnel
#### Work in progress
